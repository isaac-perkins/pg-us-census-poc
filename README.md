# ![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webanet-australia/pg-us-census-poc/master/logo.jpg) U.S Census Google Maps with PostgreSQL
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)

This repo represents a basic proof of concept for using PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension served with PostgREST to generate Google Maps.

The included database dump is populated with demographics (total population for San Francisco at block group level) from
[factfinder.census.gov](https://factfinder.census.gov) and [TIGER/LineÂ® Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/). Linking these tables within
the database and wrapping them with some views and functions allows the data to very easily be displayed in Google Maps with the maps api using map.data.addGeoJson().

This is just a simple demo, there are plenty of optimizations and work to be done for a production version. It took time to figure out and get working, hopefully this repo will save somebody that time getting started.

In the setup code below **replace**: *{your-db-name}* *{your-table-name}* *{your-db-username}* *{your-db-password}*

with values for your environment. (Yes, the curly brackets too). Run commands from the repo's root directory.

## Installation and Usage

- Install the pre-requisites, PostgreSQL, PostGIS and PostgREST. Ubuntu instructions can be found [here](docs/install.md).
- [Download](https://github.com/webanet-australia/postgres-census-poc/archive/master.zip) or clone this repo.
- Create a new database restore dump.
   ```bash
     cd repo/root-directory
     psql
   ```
   ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE {your-db-name};
      \q
   ```
- Add a role for PostgREST and restore db dump
   ```bash
     CREATE ROLE anon NOSUPERUSER NOINHERIT NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION;
     pg_restore -U postgres -d {your-db-name} -1 db/pg-census-poc.dump
   ```
- Edit PostgREST configuration with details of your environment (pretty self explanatory) but the documentation can be [found here](http://postgrest.org/en/v6.0/install.html#configuration)
- Start PostgREST

   ```bash
     bin/postgrest conf/postgrest.conf
   ```
- File open /san-francisco.html in your browser.
